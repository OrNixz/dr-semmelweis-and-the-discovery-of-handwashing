# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

Learning statistics with Python programming was a real challenge. Anyway, I'm back again to share my experience in completing the fifth project provided by DataCamp on the Data Scientist with Python Track. The previous courses before this project were tough ones; there were lots of new terms, formulas, and modules that were quite complex and unfamiliar to me, but I was able to get through them all. In this project, we were encouraged to be able to implement the proportion between two columns, then visualize it with the requested criteria, and bootstrap the analysis to be able to get the confidence interval results.


## Project Description

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
